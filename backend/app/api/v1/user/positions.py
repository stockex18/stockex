    """Close ONLY the still-open slice of this trade — issues an opposite
    market order for the trade's remaining (FIFO-leftover) quantity, NOT
    the trade's original fill quantity.

    Why this is critical (was a production bug):
      The earlier implementation used `min(t.quantity, |p.quantity|)`,
      which over-closed whenever the trade had been partially consumed
      by a prior closing leg AND the user later pyramided more lots on
      top. Example:
          BUY 5 (T1) → LONG 5
          SELL 2     → partial close, LONG 3 (T1 leftover = 3 via FIFO)
          BUY 4 (T3) → LONG 7 (active rows: T1=3, T3=4)
          User clicks "Close" on T1 (UI shows 3 lots)
              old code: close_qty = min(5, 7) = 5 → over-closed by 2
              new code: close_qty = min(leftover_for_T1=3, 7) = 3 ✓
      The visible symptom was "ek active close kiya, T3 bhi shrink ho
      gaya, position bhi 5 ki bajay 4 lots kam gayi" — exactly the
      "close one → all close" report.

    Also adds a Redis idempotency lock so a double-click (or a retry
    after a network blip) can't fire two opposite-side orders against
    the same trade in the same window — that would over-close the
    parent position, leaving a phantom short / settlement_outstanding
    shortfall that has to be cleaned up by hand.
