"""Process-wide WebSocket fan-out hubs.

The original design opened a dedicated Redis pub/sub connection per
connected WebSocket — one for ``/ws/marketdata``, one for ``/ws/user``,
one for ``/ws/admin``. With 100 K concurrent users the platform would
need ~200 K Redis connections (the default pool tops out at 300), so
the WS layer fell over long before the matching engine became the
bottleneck.

This module replaces that pattern with three singleton hubs — one per
WS endpoint type. Each hub:

  * Opens **exactly one** Redis pub/sub connection for the whole worker.
  * Maintains an in-memory ``key -> set[WebSocket]`` map. The "key" is
    a market-data token (``MarketTickHub``), a user_id (``UserChannelHub``)
    or just a constant (``AdminEventHub``).
  * Runs a single listener task that decodes each pub/sub message once
    and fans it out concurrently to every subscribed socket via
    ``safe_send_text``. Failed sends auto-unsubscribe their socket from
    every key the hub knows about, so a dead client never lingers.

This is **pure plumbing** — the wire-level WebSocket protocol the
clients see, the message shapes, the channel names, the subscribe /
unsubscribe semantics and the heartbeat/snapshot pumps are all
unchanged. Only the in-process routing is consolidated.
