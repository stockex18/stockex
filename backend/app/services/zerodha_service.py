"""Zerodha Kite Connect integration.

Wraps the official `kiteconnect` Python SDK:
  • REST: login URL, generate session, instruments CSV, quotes, historical data
  • WebSocket (KiteTicker): live binary tick stream for subscribed instruments

The service runs as a singleton (`zerodha`). Live ticks are kept in an

        Kite responds with TokenException / 403 / 401.

        Why this exists
        ---------------
        Operator reported a recurring issue: "key DB me save rehta hai
        backend restart se hi hatti hai". Kite can invalidate a token
        BEFORE its nominal 08:00 IST expiry (e.g. login from another
        device, Kite-side rotation, IP block). Our `tokenExpiry` says
        future, but every WS upgrade now returns 403. The self-heal
        loop then loops endlessly with the dead token, holding the
        Kite-side WS slot warm and preventing fresh logins from
        succeeding cleanly.

        With this probe + auto-clear, the moment Kite says "this token
        is dead" we wipe accessToken from DB. The next loop iteration
        sees `not s.accessToken`, skips, and the auto-login scheduler
        (or admin click) gets a clean slate. No restart needed.

        Historical note — why this no longer uses ``kiteconnect.KiteTicker``
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        KiteTicker runs on Twisted's reactor, which is a process-global
        singleton that CANNOT be restarted once it stops
        (``ReactorNotRestartable``). After the daily 08:00 IST token
        rotation (or any teardown) the reactor thread would die, and every
        subsequent ``KiteTicker.connect()`` silently spawned a thread that
        died instantly — the socket never opened, ``on_connect``/``on_close``
        never fired, and the admin saw "Ticker: ERROR / Last close reason:
        (none)" forever. The ONLY recovery was a full backend restart (fresh
        reactor). That was the operator's daily pain.

        This implementation mirrors the proven ``bharat_indian_funded`` MERN
        approach: a plain WebSocket straight to ``wss://ws.kite.trade``
        driven on the asyncio event loop. No Twisted, no reactor, so it can
        be opened and closed as many times as needed within one process —
        self-heal and daily re-login now recover WITHOUT a restart.
