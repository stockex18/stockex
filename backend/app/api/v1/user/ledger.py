"""User ledger — wallet transactions formatted as a running ledger.

Each row carries:
  • `type` — machine-readable transaction_type (DEPOSIT, CHARGES,
    PNL, SETTLEMENT_OUTSTANDING_BOOKED, …) for the UI to colour-code
  • `is_settlement` — fast flag so the row stands out in the table
  • `label` — human-readable category (e.g. "Brokerage", "Trade loss",
    "Settlement booked") that the user reads at a glance
  • `particulars` — long-form description with the underlying narration
  • `debit` / `credit` — split signed amount into the two columns
  • `balance` — available_balance after this txn (continuous across rows)

The aggregate fields the dashboard cards lean on:
  • `opening_balance` — first row's balance_before
  • `closing_balance` — last row's balance_after
  • `total_settlement_booked` — sum of magnitudes of every
    SETTLEMENT_OUTSTANDING_BOOKED row in this window, so the user
    sees the SETTLEMENT total prominently even if the ledger spans
    multiple trades.

Sanitisation: admin-internal transactions (REVERSAL of reopens,
SETTLEMENT_OUTSTANDING_RECOVERY from reopen unwinds, manual ADJUSTMENT
corrections) get their narrations stripped of internal terminology
("Reopen", "admin user code", "STOP_OUT", etc.) and shown to the user
as generic "Trade adjustment" rows so the user doesn't see when an
admin has corrected a position. Symbol is preserved so the user can
identify which instrument the row relates to.

    Most transaction types pass through unchanged — DEPOSIT, CHARGES,

      • REVERSAL — used both for SL/TP-bracket close reversals AND for
        admin reopens. We can't distinguish them from the row alone,
        so both get the generic "Trade adjustment" line.
      • ADJUSTMENT — used for manual admin corrections (wallet credits,
        bug fixes). Show as generic "Adjustment" unless it's a
        user-facing deposit narration (which keeps DEPOSIT type).
      • SETTLEMENT_OUTSTANDING_RECOVERY — written when settlement debt
        clears either against a deposit OR via a reopen unwind. The
        deposit-driven recovery is fine to surface; the reopen-driven
        one leaks the admin action and gets scrubbed.
