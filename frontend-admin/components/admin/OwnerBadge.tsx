/** Compact pill used in admin tables (Users / Deposits / Withdrawals /
 * Positions) to label each row as "Self" or "Broker: <name>" — and for
 * super-admin viewing, also "Admin: <name>".
 *
 * Self = the row belongs directly to the viewing admin's pool (no broker
 * in between). Broker = the row's user is in some broker's subtree; we
 * show the broker name so the admin can tell at a glance whose user it is.
 *
 * If the user was reassigned into this pool via the `Transfer User`
 * action, a secondary "Transferred" chip is rendered next to the owner
 * chip. Helps the destination admin / broker / sub-broker spot accounts
 * that landed in their dashboard through reassignment vs. ones they
 * personally created — important context when the user has trade history
 * the new owner didn't generate.
