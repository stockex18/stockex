"""Weekly mark-to-market settlement engine.

Every Saturday 00:00 IST (leader-only) this walks every OPEN ``Position``,
realises its running P&L into the wallet ledger using the EXISTING wallet
service, closes the old position and re-opens an identical fresh one at the
settlement price. Continuity is preserved — the user keeps the same side /
lots, only the entry price resets to the settlement LTP and P&L restarts
from zero.

Design guarantees (see the plan doc):
  • Purely additive — never imported by order_service / matching_engine /
    risk_enforcer, so the live trading, margin and risk paths are untouched.
  • Idempotent — a ``PositionSettlement`` row is written FIRST (unique on
    ``(batch_id, old_position_id)``); a re-run / crash-resume skips anything
    already attempted, so P&L is NEVER double-booked.
  • Duplicate-batch-proof — the ``SettlementBatch.week_key`` unique index
    means only one batch can exist per ISO week across all workers.
  • Per-position isolation — one position's failure is recorded and the
    batch keeps going for everyone else.
  • Sequential processing — wallet ``adjust`` is a read-modify-write, so we
    settle positions one at a time to avoid lost-update races on a user
    with several positions. A once-weekly job has no latency pressure.

Settlement price = last cached LTP (market is closed Saturday midnight). A
``<= 0`` / missing price means the feed has nothing valid, so that position
is SKIPPED (never settled at 0) and retried on the next run.
