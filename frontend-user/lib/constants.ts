 *  production-only bug: ops sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.stockex.com`
 *  but forgets `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`, and the build embeds the hardcoded
 *  `ws://localhost:8000` fallback. The browser then tries to open a WS to
 *  the user's own machine from a public origin and the connection fails
 *  silently — quotes appear in the chart (REST `/quote` polling) but the
 *  instruments panel and positions strip show "—" because they depend on
 *  the tick stream.
 *
 *  Auto-derivation: `http://` → `ws://`, `https://` → `wss://`. An
 *  explicit `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` always wins so a split API/WS host (e.g.
 *  separate `ws.stockex.com` later) still works without changing this file. */
