"""Canonical lot sizes for Indian index F&O contracts.

**Platform-owned, not exchange-tracking.** We're a B-book broker (see
CLAUDE.md → "B-Book broker model") so the contract size we charge users
is a business decision, not whatever Zerodha's instruments CSV reports
for the current exchange revision. This table is the authoritative
source for NSE/BSE F&O lot sizes and OVERRIDES the live CSV.

Used in:
  • Auto-create of an Instrument from the Zerodha cache.
  • Startup backfill (`backfill_index_lot_sizes`) that rewrites existing
    rows to match this table.
  • Admin repair endpoint `/admin/instruments/repair-index-lots`.

Order matters: longer prefixes first so "MIDCPNIFTY…" doesn't match as
"NIFTY", "BANKNIFTY…" doesn't match as "NIFTY", etc.
