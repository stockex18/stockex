"""Broker tier — create/manage brokers (admin → broker, broker → sub-broker).

Mirrors `admin_management_service.py` for the broker layer. Two key
differences vs. sub-admin:

  1. Permissions are TRI-STATE (`PermissionLevel.OFF | VIEW | EDIT`)
     rather than boolean. Every grant is validated against the actor's
     own cap via `max_grantable_perms(actor)`.
  2. Brokers can nest. A broker creating a sub-broker propagates its
     ancestry (`new.broker_ancestry = creator.broker_ancestry + [creator.id]`)
     so a single multikey query on `broker_ancestry` scopes the whole
     subtree.

All mutations write an audit-log entry. Pure data layer — HTTP shaping
lives in `app/api/v1/admin/brokers.py`.

    Scope comes from `assert_broker_in_scope`, so an ADMIN can only reach the
    brokers in their own pool, a BROKER only their own subtree, and a
    SUPER_ADMIN only unassigned brokers. Unlike `delete_user` — which is
    super-admin-only — this is deliberately available to the owning admin:
    they minted the broker, so they may retire it.

    REFUSES rather than cascading. A broker is the parent of real accounts and
    real money, and a silent cascade here would orphan them:

      * live clients  → their `assigned_broker_id` would point at a closed
                        row, and `broker_ancestry` lookups that scope pools,
                        settlements and commissions would silently miss them.
      * sub-brokers   → same, one level deeper.
      * wallet funds  → balance / used margin would simply stop being
                        reachable by anyone.

    So each is reported back and the caller is told what to clear first. Move
    the users with the existing "transfer user" flow, settle the wallet, then
    retry.
