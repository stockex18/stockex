    This nets ONLY the settlement booked during the just-finished batch
    (`current_outstanding − settlement_before`) and ONLY up to the cash
    now sitting in `available_balance`. Pre-existing settlement and a
    genuine capital-exhausted shortfall (no available left to cover it)
    are left untouched — so this does NOT re-introduce the deliberately
    removed "recover settlement from future deposits" behaviour. It is
    net-neutral on equity: available_balance and settlement_outstanding
    drop by the same amount. Writes one SETTLEMENT_OUTSTANDING_RECOVERY
    ledger row so the correction is auditable.

    ATOMIC (version-guarded): the net is applied with an optimistic-
    concurrency loop so it can never lose to / be lost by a concurrent
    `release_margin` / `adjust` still finishing the same stop-out batch —
    the exact race that let the phantom survive uncorrected before.
