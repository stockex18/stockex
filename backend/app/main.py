# and run multiple sweeps on a single event loop — exactly the 3-shards-on-one-
# worker case that starved the loop (3s+ `ltp_ms`, 14s `risk_enforcer_tick_overrun`).
# This per-PROCESS gate caps a worker at one risk shard and prefers to keep
# shards off the feed leader (already saturated by the 0.1s tick fanout), so the
# N shards fan out across N distinct workers.
#
# SAFETY (correctness > balance): if a shard stays denied for a few poll cycles
# — fewer live workers than shards, e.g. after a crash — the gate relaxes so the
# shard is NEVER left un-enforced (which would mean no SL/TP/stop-out for those
# users). The per-shard Redis lock still guarantees exactly one runner, so a
# relaxed attempt only ever wins a genuinely unclaimed shard. All logic here is

    concurrent Mongo+Redis pings → ~850 ms; this path stays sub-ms and
