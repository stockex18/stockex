"""Risk Management background enforcer.

Runs every 250 ms (see `risk_enforcer_loop` default). Implements the
simplified spec:

    stopOutWarningPercent  — notify when (-total_pnl) / balance × 100 ≥ this %.
                             "balance" = wallet.available + used_margin + credit_limit
                             (matches the admin UI help text).
    stopOutPercent         — force-close EVERY open position when the same
                             ratio crosses this %.
    profitTradeHoldMinSeconds / lossTradeHoldMinSeconds / exitOnlyMode are
    enforced synchronously by the order validator; they don't need a
    background loop.

Plus a built-in bracket SL / TP scan per position (LONG: SL when LTP ≤ SL,
TP when LTP ≥ TP; SHORT: mirrored). The pending-order poller handles
stand-alone LIMIT / SL-M; bracket legs attached to positions land here.

    """Background loop launched from the FastAPI lifespan.

    DEFAULT (shard_id=0, num_shards=1) = the original single-loop behaviour.
    When num_shards > 1 this loop only enforces the users this shard owns
    (`enforce_once(shard_id, num_shards)`); main.py starts one such loop per
    shard, each under its own `leader:risk:shard:{k}` lock on a different
    worker.

    250 ms cadence — four sweeps per second — so an SL/TP bracket or
    a stop-out threshold breach is caught within ~quarter of a second
    of the price crossing it, instead of the old 5-s gap that let
    LTP drift several ticks past the trigger before the close booked.

    Per-tick cost is small by design:
      • `enforce_once` issues ONE indexed Mongo `distinct` to find
        users with open positions.
      • `_enforce_for_user` parallelises every LTP lookup, and reads
        wallet + risk policy from Redis-backed cache.
      • `refresh_unrealized_pnl` is in-memory — no Mongo write per
        tick. Saves only happen when something actually fires
        (close, self-heal).
      • Bracket fires are idempotent (closed positions filter out of
        the next sweep) and the squareoff path uses an atomic Mongo
        claim to dedup across workers / leader handoffs.

    Drift-corrected sleep: we measure how long the tick took and
    sleep for the REMAINDER of the interval, not a fixed slice. So
    an 80-ms tick is followed by a 170-ms sleep — keeping the real
    cadence locked at `interval_sec` regardless of load, instead of
    compounding to 330 ms per tick the way a fixed sleep would.

    Overrun warning: if a tick exceeds the interval we log it once
    at WARNING (`risk_enforcer_tick_overrun`). That's the operator
    signal to either bump the interval or scale workers — we still
    complete the tick (no skip), but the user is told the risk loop
    is falling behind so they can act on it.
